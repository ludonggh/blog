When I started to pay attention to my writing, one of the most often occurred mistakes is the “subject-verb agreement”. We don’t have such a thing in Chinese. Apparently, in English, whenever you utter a verb, your brain is choosing its tense (write or wrote) and its form (write or writes). It is easy, you may say, whenever you encounter a singular noun, use the singular form of the verb, and for a plural noun, use the plural form. Only if it is that simple!

Of course, I am not in a place to tell you grammar tips. I summarised what I learnt so far from Steven Pinker (one of my favourite non-fiction writer).

## None, Any, No

None has always been either singular or plural, depending on whether the writer is pondering the entire group at once or each member individually. The singular (*None of the students was doing well*) feels a bit more specific and emphatic than the plural (*None of the students were doing well*), and is often **stylistically preferable** for that reason. 

But when an additional quantifier forces us to carve out a subset of the group and say something about that subset, the plural is irresistible: *Almost none of them are honest* (not is); *None but his closest friends believe his alibi*. 

**Any** can also swing both ways: *Are any of the children coming?* *Any of the tools is fine*.

So it is with **no**, depending on the number of the noun it quantifies: *No man is an island*; *No men are islands*. 

## Neither, either, anyone, everyone, somebody, everybody, nothing

In contrast to the above three terms, which specify pure **not-ness** and lack of inherent number, some quantifiers do single out one individual at a time. 

**Neither** means “not one of the two,” and it is singular: *Neither book was any good*.

The same is true of **either**, even when it picks one item from a pair: *Either of the candidates is experienced enough to run the country*.

Likewise, the *one* in **anyone** and **everyone**, the *body* in **somebody** and **everybody**, and the *thing* in **nothing** shout that they are referring to one thing at a time , and that makes each of them singular: 
- Anyone is welcome to try.
- Everyone eats at my house.
- Everybody is a star.
- Nothing is easy.

## nouns coordinated with **and**

When two singular nouns are coordinated with *and*, the phrase is usually plural, as if the language is acknowledging that one plus one equals two:
- A fool and his money are soon parted.
- Frankie and Johnny were lovers.

But when the duo is mentally packaged as a single entity, it can be singular: 
- One and one and one is three.
- Macaroni and cheese is a good dinner for kids. 

What happens with other words that join nouns together, like *with*, *plus*, and *or*?

*With* is a preposition, so the phrase *a man with his son* is not a coordination at all but an ordinary phrase with the head *a man*, modified by *with his son*. It inherits the singular number of its head, so we say *A man with his son is coming up the walk.*.

The word *plus* began as a preposition, and again we say *All that food plus the weight of the backpack is a lot to carry.* But *plus* is increasingly being used as a coordinator as well, and it’s natural to say *The hotel room charge plus the surcharge add up to a lot of money.*

## Or

A disjunction of two singular nouns is singular: *Either beer or wine is served.*

A disjunction of two plurals is plural: *Either nuts or pretzel are served*.

With a disjunction of a singular and a plural, traditional grammar books say that number agreement goes with the noun closest to the verb: *Either a burrito or nachos are served; Either nachos or a burrito is served.* But that policy leaves many writers queasy, and it may be best to spare readers from stretching their grammatical intuitions and recast the sentence, such as *They serve either nachos or a burrito.*

## A lot of, a pair of, and majority of

Certain nouns specify a measure and then indicate what they’re measuring using an *of*-phrase, such as *a lot of peanuts, a pair of socks,* and *a majority of the voters*. These Zelig-like  nouns can be singular or plural depending on the number of the *of*-phrase: *A lot of work was done; A lot of errors were made.* When the *of*-phrase is absent, the writer mentally supplies it, and the phantom phrase determines the number: *A lot “of people” were coming; A lot “of money” was spent*. Other chameleonic quantifiers include *couple, majority, more than one, pair, percentage, plenty, remainder, rest* and *subset*.
