I know Leslie through her TED talk on Chinese factory girls. I enjoyed her book a lot. It opened up a new perspective on how to look at my people. 

The book has two narrations, one focuses on her encountering in dongguan and the other is about Leslie’s own family linage. These two narrations is somewhat disjoint, I would wish to know more about Leslie’s personal background rather than that of her families. Her narration of the factory girl is warm and funny, I could imagine the Chinese version of every dialogue she has with these girls.
