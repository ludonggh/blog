I know Leslie through her TED talk on Chinese factory girls. I enjoyed her book a lot. It opened up a new perspective on how to look at my people. 

The book has two narrations, one focuses on her encountering in dongguan and the other is about Leslie’s own family linage. These two narrations is somewhat disjoint, I would wish to know more about Leslie’s personal background rather than that of her families. Her narration of the factory girl is warm and funny, I could imagine the Chinese version of every dialogue she has with these girls. 

Millions of girls left their home to come to the city for better life, especially to places like Dongguan. Most of them work in the factory, some work in sex industry. The author captured several common features of these girls: 

1) They are strivers. I know from my bone this desire and determination for a better life. I know it from the words my primary school teacher said: you strive every minute for better exam scores. Most girls work in assembly lines and they work 10 hours per day and 6.5 days a week. They have almost zero me-time, and they are squeezed in a 12 people room with the living condition Leslie resembles as prison. Yet, they strive every day to learn new things. They are constantly worried of being lagged behind by newest trend and keen to educate themselves. 

2) They learn social relations and english. It makes me laugh out loud to learn the author’s experience in vocational school, seeing how these girls are instructed to speak english and display social manner.
