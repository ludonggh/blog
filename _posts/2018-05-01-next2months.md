I recently learnt an English word called “strive”, and I love that word. It captures determination and hard work. Though hard work doesn’t necessarily lead to success, I believe success needs lots of hard work. It is not the dull hardwork, let’s call it smart hardwork. It is the state where you just love what you are doing or you are in the flow. I am strive to that state. 

The nature of work in academia is similar to that of free-lancer and writer. Except for the teaching duties, we are almost like self-employed person. We develop our research, conduct our own research, and market it for publications. I usually regard myself as a writer, thought the audience is very limited. Like writers, enormous self motivation is need. I’m constantly striving for new methods to keep myself on track. 

I have sticked with my bullet journal for a month now, and it helped me to accomplish lots of tasks. It works as below: I write down everything I want to do for the next day at night, and plan the next week at Friday afternoon. I can then hold myself accountable by checking back on my progress. 

**Calendar** seems to be left out for occasional meeting schedules, which I only have a few during my work week. My calendar looks empty most of the time. I try to plan my todos from my bullet journal on my calendar, but the success rate is very low. I ponder that the problem lies on my calendar habit. 

I dedicate this month to my calendar. I strive to find a way to incorporate my calendar with my work routine. The current calendar app I installed on my phone is called “Fantastical 2” (I don’t think which app you use is going to make a big difference, as long as it works). 

The thing about calendar is that I will have to attend appointment listed in the calendar (e.g., meetings): even if it is not on my calendar, it is in my mind. But the other things, the one I arbitrarily for myself, I tend to treat it not so seriously. I once read a book called “how to write a lot“, the most important advice it gives is that you don’t **find** time to write, but you **allot** time. The author argues whether you **find** time to teach lectures (or attend lectures)? No, you allot time to do so. The only secret to write a lot, is to allot time on your calendar and stick with it. Talking about that book \<How to write a lot\>, the other important lesson I learnt is to track one’s writing on a sheet. I have seen many productive people use that tools. We need some tool to track our progress, so we know how we are doing towards our goals. It can serve as a motivational tool. I have thus set up my first excel sheet. Does it sound crazy? I will report back next time. 

Back to the discussion about the calendar.
