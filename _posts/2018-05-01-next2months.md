I recently learnt an English word called “strive”, and I love that word. It captures determination and hard work. Though hard work doesn’t necessarily lead to success, I believe success needs lots of hard work. It is not the dull hardwork, let’s call it smart hardwork. It is the state where you just love what you are doing or you are in the flow. I am strive to that state. 

The nature of work in academia is similar to that of free-lancer and writer. Except for the teaching duties, we are almost like self-employed person. We develop our research, conduct our own research, and market it for publications. I usually regard myself as a writer, thought the audience is very limited. Like writers, enormous self motivation is need. I’m constantly striving for new methods to keep myself on track. 

I have sticked with my bullet journal for a month now, and it helped me to accomplish lots of tasks. It works as below: I write down everything I want to do for the next day at night, and plan the next week at Friday afternoon. I can then hold myself accountable by checking back on my progress. 

**Calendar** seems to be left out for occasional meeting schedules, which I only have a few during my work week. My calendar looks empty most of the time. I try to plan my todos from my bullet journal on my calendar, but the success rate is very low. I ponder that the problem lies on my calendar habit. 

I dedicate this month to my calendar. I strive to find a way to incorporate my calendar with my work routine. b
