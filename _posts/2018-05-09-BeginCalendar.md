This post is not about how to use a calendar, instead it is about how to I wish I could master the art of using a calendar. I’m not the master yet, only a humble beginner. I’ve always dreamed to be a kind of lady, when being asked to an invitation, she would reply meditatively, I will consult my calendar to confirm. My day used to be in the mode of first-come-first-serve. I do the first thing that comes into my mind, then the next, without any game plan. 

An important moment came to me when I was visiting a professor and she said she forbade her secretary to write anything on her calendar and she allot the morning time exclusively for writing. Two big revelations: first, she walks through her day according to her calendar (wow!), and second, she dedicates her morning time consciously to the thing of her choice. 

I have a rough calendar system to write my appointment/meeting. Back to my teaching years, I wrote my teaching schedules there. But except for that, my calendar is empty, as if I have nothing to do. I have some failed attempt of wishful planning, such as I will get up at 5.30am. These failed attempts brings me shame.

**Now, I pledge my loyalty to my calendar. I will plan my day and try my very best to keep my plan. **

I believe it is doable now that I had a one month trial period with this commitment. Specifically, what I do is at the beginning of a week, I spend 1 hour planning session, write down everything I want to accomplish in the following week and the estimated time that thing would need. I then block time on my calendar for that specific task. For example, if my goal of the week is to practice yoga for 5 hours, I then block time on my calendar where these 5 hours came from. Note that we have 168 hours a week to fill. Before I go to bed, I check and readjust my calendar. This process works with my bullet journal system.

Another thing I’m trying right now is to virtually study with friends. I and a couple of my friends shared a study session calendar, and if our study time overlap, we would study together in an app called “forest”. So far, it worked well. Studying or doing research can become lonely, let me know if you want to study with me by shooting me an email.
