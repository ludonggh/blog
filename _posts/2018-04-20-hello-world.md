Hello Readers! I used to have a nice blog that I kept for three years. But due to the cost of web hosting service, I decided to switch to a free hosting platform (github). This is hence my new blog. I work in academics (economics) and have just accepted an offer as an assistant professor from a Chinese university in Nanjing. 

As the title of this blog suggested, I enjoyed reading, writing and doing yoga a lot. I believe in the value of planning and recording. I wish to share with you these things and my day-to-day thoughts as we are on this life journey together.
